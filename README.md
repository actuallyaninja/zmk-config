# zmk-config
Repo to set up ZMK firmware builds

Boards with config files include some that are standard boards, 
just customized with my keympaps, plus some boards that were not 
set up in zmk which I've built and configured here. Some of the 
boards that I ported into ZMK include:

Keeb.io designed boards:

- Viterbi, a split 5X7 (x2) ortholinear keyboard
- Fourier, a split 40% staggered keyboard
- A hand-wired board using the plates from the Sinc 75% split staggered keyboard

Other boards:

- Ergo42, a split 4x7 (x2) ortholinear board designed by Biacco42
- May pad, a numpad designed by u/reggatronics

Other board(s) that I have a config for that were part of the main zmk repo:

- Helix
- Lily58
