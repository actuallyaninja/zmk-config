# zmk-config
Repo to set up ZMK firmware builds

Boards with config files include some that are standard boards, 
just customized with my keympaps, plus some boards that were not 
set up in zmk which I've built and configured here. Some of the 
boards that I ported into ZMK include the Fourier, split 40% 
staggered keyboard designed by Keeb.io, and a hand-wired board
using the plates from the Sinc 75% split staggered keyboard, also 
designed by Keeb.io.
