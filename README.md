# zmk-config
Repo to set up ZMK firmware builds

This repo includes config files for some keyboards that are 
already part of the main ZMK repo, just customized with my key maps, 
plus some that were not set up in ZMK which I've added support for here. 
Some of the keyboards that I've added support for in ZMK include:

Keeb.io designed boards ported into ZMK:

- Viterbi, a split 5x7 (x2) ortholinear keyboard
- Fourier, a split 40% row-staggered keyboard

Other boards:

- Ergo42, a split 4x7 (x2) ortholinear board designed by Biacco42
- May pad, a numpad designed by u/reggatronics
- Sofle Rev2 w/ RBG
- orthosnap: Adafruit NeoKey 5x6 Ortho Snap-apart (x2) wired to a single controller
- A hand-wired board using the plates from the Keeb.io Sinc 75% split staggered keyboard

Other board(s) that I have my own config for that were already part of the main zmk repo:

- Helix
- Lily58
